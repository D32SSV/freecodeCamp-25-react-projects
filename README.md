# React + Vite

This is a practice project based on the <a href="https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/master-react-by-building-25-projects" >freecode camp website</a> for react interview.

Apart from building the components as per this course. I will try to add some custome feature to the components based on my extent of creativity, knowledge, etc. Hopefully We will rock this!!
